# Matt's Manager README
Welcome to the team! I’m so glad you're here.

If you're reading this it's likely that I am either your manager or a prospective coworker. One of the working relationships we need to define is ours.

# A Little About Me

When I'm not coding or managing, I love to garden. I love plants and have a hard time not buying plants when I see them. If our space doesn't have plants it in, I'll bring them in. I've brought a bunch of biggish plants into previous offices to brighten the space.

I have three dogs and used to volunteer at a dog shelter.

I drink too much coffee. I love coffee. I've taken classes on espresso brewing and own a semi-fancy espresso machine.

I like to cook but I'm adequate at best. I make an OK breakfast. I lived in Australia for a bit and acquired a taste for Vegemite.

# Overview
This document is, and always will be, a work in progress. It’s meant to be documentation on me. As I change and examine my values, so will this document.

Three reasons for this to exist:
 - The creation has helped me identify my [responsibilities](./responsibilities.md) and [values](./values.md)
 - Hopefully this helps you understand me and helps us [work together](./together.md)
 - It captures what you can expect out of an average week [working here](./working.md)

**Important**: *This is NOT meant as a replacement for getting to know each other. It's also not a set of excuses for bad behavior. I don't get to be a jerk because I warned you in advance.*
