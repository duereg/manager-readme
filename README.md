# Matt's Manager README
Welcome to the team! I’m so glad you are here.

If you're reading this it's likely that I am either your manager or a prospective coworker. This readme should cover what to expect when working with me. One of the working relationships we need to define is ours. The following is a user guide for me and how I work. It captures what you can expect out of the average week working with me, how I like to work, my principles, and some details of how I act and react.

## Notice
This is a new document and still a work in progress. It’s meant to be documentation on me.

Two reasons for this to exist

Life > work. Make the balance work. I take vacations. You should, too. We only get one life. Don’t burn out. Take time off.

# Working Together

## My Assumptions
 -  You’re very good at your job.

    You wouldn’t be here if you weren’t. If it feels like I’m questioning you it’s because I’m either:
      1) Trying to gather context.
      2) Trying to be a sounding board and rubber duck.

 - I’m not good at your job.

    You know best. I’ll work to provide necessary context and ask questions to help you vet your ideas but I won’t override you.

 - You’ll let me know if you can’t do your job.

    One of my main responsibilities is ensuring that you’re set up for success. Occasionally things slip through the cracks and I won’t know I’m letting you down.

 - You feel safe debating with me.

    I find that ideas improve by being examined from all angles. If it sounds like I’m disagreeing I’m most likely just playing devil’s advocate. This does rely on us being able to have a safe debate.

## How can I help you?
 - Provide context.

    Most of my day is spent collecting, filtering and sharing context/information from across other projects, domains, and products. I’ll try to push information to you as much as I can but feel free to ask about anything else.

 - Provide an outside(ish) perspective.

    I won’t be working on your project day to day but will be close enough to have informed thoughts.

 - Cheer.

    I will celebrate your successes. If you're not a person who self-promotes, please let me do it for you. Tell me when things go well, share the things which make you proud, and I'll cheer/share appropriately.

 - Firefight.

    If my favorite opening line is "I could use a hand with...", my second favorite is "I screwed up: ...". A mistake, if shared, becomes a challenge; if hidden, becomes a failure.

 - Other.

    Please let me know how else I can help.

## How can you help me?
 - Do amazing work.

    This is the expectation. Let me know if there is something preventing you from accomplishing this.

 - Disagree with me.

    The best solutions comes from a healthy level of debate. We need to be able to separate our ideas from our egos . I’ll challenge your ideas with the goal of coming to the best possible solution, I hope you’ll challenge mine. Disagreement is feedback and the sooner we learn how to efficiently disagree with each other, the sooner we’ll trust and respect each other more. Ideas don’t get better with agreement.

 - Tell me when I screw up.

    This is very important. I screw up and sometimes don’t notice. I need to know or I’ll likely do it again. I am going to ask you for feedback in our 1:1s. I am never going to stop doing this no matter how many times you say you have no feedback for me.

 - Communicate.

    One of my jobs is to provide context. Are you missing some? Let me know and I’ll fill you in or go find out.

 - Bring your friends.

    We’re growing the team and you know who you want to work with.

## My Calendar
I go to a lot of meetings. My calendar is deliberately publicly visible. If you have a question about a meeting on my calendar, ask me. If a meeting is private or confidential, its title and attendees will be hidden from your view. The vast majority of my meetings are neither private nor confidential.

Need clarification on something? Blocked? I’d love to hear as soon as possible. Come by my desk, send me a message, we don’t need to wait for our next scheduled 1:1.

Feel free to put something in my calendar, don’t feel like you need to ask first.
Is my calendar full? Send me a message and I’ll very likely be able to move something around.

# Working Here

## Our Average Week
Every morning we'll have a brief 5-10 minute standup where everyone will discuss what they've been working on, what they will work on, and anything that is blocking them.

We’ll have a 1:1 every week to two weeks for at least 30 minutes. This meeting discusses topics of substance as well as updates. Use our private Slack channel to capture future topics for our 1:1s as well as to provide a handy historic record of what we’ve discussed. When you or I think of a topic, let's dump it in that channel.

We’ll have a team planner with your peers every two weeks for 30-60 minutes. We'll discuss what we've been working on briefly, and what we're planning on working on the next two weeks.

We'll also have a team retro every two weeks for about an hour, where we discuss what has and hasn't been working for us as a team. Every retro should have actionable items that we follow up on.

## Scheduling Meetings
If you schedule a meeting, you must provide at a minimum:

1) A hangout link or similar to the meeting for remote callers
2) An agenda of what we're talking about
3) Any related documents, slidedecks, etc that will be used in the meeting

## Meeting Protocol
Put away your phone. If your laptop is open, you're taking notes or running the meeting.

If I am attending a meeting, I’d prefer starting on time. If I am running a meeting, I will start that meeting on time. If it’s not clear to me why I am in a meeting, I will ask for clarification on my attendance.

If you send me a presentation deck before a meeting, I will usually read it before the meeting and will have my questions at the ready. If I haven’t read the deck, I will tell you.

If a meeting completes its intended purpose before it’s scheduled to end, let’s give the time back to everyone. If it’s clear the intended goal won’t be achieved in the allotted time, let’s stop the meeting before time is up and determine how to finish the meeting later.

# Miscellanous Things to Know
When I ask you to do something that feels poorly defined you should ask me for both clarification and a call on importance. I might still be brainstorming. These questions can save everyone a lot of time.
