# <a name="together"></a> Working Together
### My Assumptions
 -  You’re very good at your job

    You wouldn’t be here if you weren’t. If it feels like I’m questioning you it’s because I’m either:
      - Trying to gather context.
      - Trying to be a sounding board, rubber duck, or devils advocate.

 - I’m not good at your job

    You know best. I’ll work to provide necessary context and ask questions to help you vet your ideas.

 - You’ll let me know if you can’t do your job

    One of my main responsibilities is ensuring that you’re set up for success. Things slip through the cracks and I won’t know I’m letting you down.

 - You feel safe talking with me

    Examining ideas from all angles improves them. This relies on us being able to have safe communications. I've read that feedback requires three attributes:

      - Safety (you should feel safe to give and receive candid feedback)
      - Effort (neither you nor I should feel defensive about the feedback, and feedback should be easy to give)
      - Benefit (giving/receiving feedback should have impact)

    Please let me know if I’m doing poorly on any of these attributes. I’ll return the favor!

### How can I help you?
 - Provide context

    I spend most of my day collecting, filtering and sharing context/information from across other projects, domains, and products. I’ll try to push information to you as much as I can but feel free to ask about anything else.

 - Provide an outside(ish) perspective

    I won’t be working on your project day to day but will be close enough to have informed thoughts.

 - Cheer

    I will celebrate your successes. If you're not a person who self-promotes, please let me do it for you. Tell me when things go well, share what makes you proud, and I'll cheer/share appropriately.

 - Firefight

    If my favorite opening line is "I could use a hand with...", my second favorite is "I screwed up: ...".
      - *A mistake, if shared, becomes a challenge; if hidden, becomes a failure.*

 - Other

    Please let me know how else I can help.

### How can you help me?
 - Do amazing work

    This is the expectation. Let me know if there is something preventing you from accomplishing this.

 - Disagree with me

    The best solutions comes from a healthy level of communication. We need to be able to separate our ideas from our egos. I’ll challenge your ideas with the goal of coming to the best possible solution; I hope you’ll challenge mine. Disagreement is feedback and the sooner we learn how to efficiently disagree with each other, the sooner we’ll trust and respect each other more. Ideas don’t get better with agreement.

 - Tell me when I screw up

    This is important. I screw up and sometimes don’t notice. I need to know or I’ll likely do it again. I am going to ask you for feedback in our 1:1s. I am never going to stop doing this no matter how many times you say you have no feedback for me.

 - Communicate

    One of my jobs is to provide context. Are you missing some? Let me know and I’ll fill you in or go find out.

    The best way for me to retain information is to read it. If you have something that is nuanced and needs a detailed opinion, you'd be best served writing down your thoughts and sending them to me. It's easy for me to miss details in a hallway conversation.

    A good way to structure writings is by leveraging [SCQA](https://www.harrisonmetal.com/library/storytelling-amp-presenting-1-thank-you-barbara-minto).

 - Bring your friends

    We’re growing the team and you know who you want to work with.

### How I Give Feedback
<!-- TODO: Describe your approach to giving feedback. For example, do you prefer to give it directly, in 1:1s, written, or verbally? What's your philosophy on constructive criticism? -->

### Preferred Communication Channels
<!-- TODO: Specify your preferred communication methods. For example:
    - Quick questions: Slack DM
    - Detailed discussions: Schedule a brief meeting or send an email with a document.
    - Urgent issues: Slack DM or come by my desk.
    Consider mentioning if you prefer threads in Slack, or if email is better for documentation purposes. -->

### My Calendar
I go to a lot of meetings. My calendar is deliberately publicly visible. If you have a question about a meeting on my calendar, ask me. If a meeting is private or confidential, its title and attendees are hidden from your view. The vast majority of my meetings are neither private nor confidential.

Need clarification on something? Blocked? I’d love to hear as soon as possible. Come by my desk, send me a message, it shouldn't to wait for our next scheduled 1:1.

Feel free to put something in my calendar, don’t feel like you need to ask first.
Is my calendar full? Send me a message and I’ll likely be able to move something around.
