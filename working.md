### Our Average Week

#### Standup
Every morning we'll have a brief 5-10 minute standup where everyone will discuss what they've been working on, what they will work on, and anything that is blocking them.

#### 1:1's
We’ll have a 1:1 every week to two weeks for at least 30 minutes. This meeting discusses topics of substance and updates. Edit our 1:1 notes to capture future topics for our 1:1s and to provide a handy historic record of what we’ve discussed. When you or I think of a topic, let's dump them into the 1:1 notes. During 1:1s we will go through your agenda first and if time permits I will have some questions. These meetings are for you. Urgent matters should not wait for a 1:1.

1:1's do not have to be face to face. We can take a walking 1:1 where we call one another, we can be camera down for remote 1:1's, etc. I'm flexible to find a format that works for you.

#### Planner
We’ll have a team planner with your peers every week or two for 30-60 minutes. We'll discuss what we've been working on briefly, and what we're planning on working on for the next week or two.

Depending on the team and the nature of the work, planners will either span the entire team or be broken up on a project basis. The cadence will be the same either way.

#### Retrospectives
We'll also have a team retro at least every two weeks for about an hour, where we discuss what has and hasn't been working for us as a team. Retros will normally start with a review of the action items from the previous retro and our progress there.

Every retro should have actionable items that we follow up on.

#### Career Growth
We'll meet on a regular basis to discuss your career growth. The cadence can differ from company to company and person to person, but anywhere as frequent as once/month to once/quarter of dedicated time to just discuss your career.

Please note this does not preclude us talking about your career in our 1:1's - it's just that you can expect to have time dedicated on your calendar for career development outside of our normal 1:1 cadence.

This time is useful to track progress towards your career goals and make sure we're aligned.

### Scheduling Meetings
If you schedule a meeting, please provide:

1) A zoom link or similar to the meeting for remote callers
2) An agenda of what we're talking about
3) Any related documents, slidedecks, etc that will be used in the meeting

### Meeting Protocol
Put away your phone. Only open your laptop if you're taking notes, reading relevant material, or running the meeting.

If I am attending a meeting, I’d prefer starting on time. If it’s not clear to me why I am in a meeting, I will ask for clarification on my attendance.

If you send me a presentation deck before a meeting, I will usually read it before the meeting and will have my questions at the ready. If I haven’t read the deck, I will tell you.

If a meeting completes its purpose before it’s scheduled to end, let’s give the time back to everyone. If it’s clear the purpose won’t be achieved in the allocated time, let’s end the meeting early and determine how to finish the meeting later.

One of my pet peeves is when someone schedules a meeting before normal working hours and then is late for that meeting. Please don't do this.

# Miscellanous Things to Know
When I ask you to do something that feels poorly defined you should ask me for both clarification and a call on importance. I might still be brainstorming. These questions can save everyone a lot of time.

My job is a series of interruptions during the day. If I'm busy and folks ask me questions, I usually say something like, "I need five minutes to wrap this up." If I really need alone time, I'll find a beanbag, sit in a café, or book a room to get something done. Otherwise I try to be as available as possible when I'm at my desk. My job is to help you succeed, and your output is more valuable than mine.
